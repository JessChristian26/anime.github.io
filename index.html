                            <p>Anime’s popularity has been on the rise through the past decade perhaps due to many series <br>receiving dubs, the release successful anime feature films, or the rise of streaming services. <br>There is a lot of anime to watch but often times, releases can blend together due to their <br>sheer number. The many genres of anime such as shonen, shoujo, seinen and isekai can <br>sometimes feel overwhelming when people just want to watch a silly romantic comedy or <br>fantasy series. Here’s a helpful breakdown of all of the major anime genres and where to get <br>started with them all.
                            </div>
                        <div class="blog__details__item__text">
                            <h4>Shonen:</h4>
                            <img src="images/shonen.jpg" alt="">
                            <p>The shonen genre is by far the most popular brand of anime and the majority of breakout hits <br> and major successes like Dragon Ball Z, Naruto, and One Piece all fit into the shonen brand. <br> What’s interesting about anime genres is that they’re treated more like demographics and <br> shonen is content that caters to boys with a young male protagonist. Shonen is so accessible <br>because beyond this basic disclaimer, it’s able to cover a wide berth of content and a show like<br> My Hero Academia can be completely different from Yu Yu Hakusho, yet they can still fall back<br> on the same values. <p> Shonen anime has largely been generalized to be series that feature lots of fighting and battles,<br> which isn’t always the case, but has become quite representative of the genre. Shonen series<br> are ideal for people that want lots of action and are hungry for a show that has hundreds of<br> episodes to consume.</p>

                        <div class="blog__details__item__text">
                            <h4>Slice of Life:</h4>
                            <img src="images/sliceoflife.jpg" alt="">
                            <p>Slice of life anime are those endlessly soothing series that don’t try to create major spectacles <br> where the planet is at risk, but instead celebrate the mundanity of life. Slice of life series may<br> center around the staff at a job, a group of friends in a high school club, or just a loner that’s<br> moved to a new community. These are series that elegantly display the tiny moments that<br> make life important and the bonds that create eternal friendships.<p>The stakes are often more muted in slice of life anime, but that doesn’t mean that they’re<br> without tension or can’t dabble in fantastical material. There are still slice of life anime series<br> that involve magical creatures or are set in unbelievable worlds. It’s sometimes even more<br> humbling to learn that some planet in a far away solar system has a struggling chess club or<br> that a dinosaur can be obsessed with different brands of candy..</p>
                        </div>
                        <div class="blog__details__item__text">
                            <h4>Fantasy/Isekai:</h4>
                            <img src="images/fantasy.jpg" alt="">
                            <p>The isekai genre is perfect for fans of fantasy and this style of anime has become wildly popular <br> over the course of the past decade. Isekai anime is any show where a character gets <br> transported away to a fantastical new world. It’s a classic storytelling idea, but anime has been <br> able to run with it in some creative new ways. There’s an abundance of isekai series that<br> incorporate video game aesthetics and there are now just as many series where characters are <br>trapped in a video game world than some alternate fantasy dimension.<p>Isekai can focus on the protagonist’s mission to return home, act as a savior in their new world,<br> or simply kill time and enjoy the vacation. There are even reverse isekai anime where a <br>supernatural character gets stuck on Earth and must acclimate. Arguably the biggest most <br>mainstream example of isekai content is Spirited Away, but even something as foundational<br> as Alice in Wonderland would qualify..</p>
                        </div>
                        <div class="blog__details__item__text">
                            <h4>Comedy:</h4>
                            <img src="images/comedy.jpg" alt="">
                            <p>Anime series are able to achieve a lot of things that just can’t be accomplished in other forms of animation <br> or programming. Comedy is something that’s able to connect extremely hard in anime and operate at an<br> absurdist level that uses visuals, timing, and premises that are rare to find elsewhere. Many anime series<br> have a sense of humor or are even specifically designed as comedies, but gag anime are a different breed<br> that operate at an overwhelmingly relentless pace.

                            <p>Reality and the fourth wall are just things to break in gag series, which often engage in wild parodies and<br> lampshade anime as a whole. Some gag anime have extended storylines, but they often operate in shorter<br> vignette style sequences that allow the comedy to really pop. Gag anime thrive in pop culture references<br>and some of the hardest times I’ve laughed in my entire life have been at gag series like Mr. Osomatsu and<br> Gintama where comedy is king.</p>
                        </div>
                        <div class="blog__details__item__text">
                            <h4>Romance:</h4>
                            <img src="images/romance.jpeg" alt="">
                            <p>Like comedy, romance transcends the constraints of its genre and has elements in other genre series. With<br> romance, you typically get your love story that benefits from viewer investment into characters. There’s<br> different variations with love triangles and harems, but ultimately the viewer knows what they’re getting. <br>Scum’s Wish is a series that throws viewers into a situation where they can be uncomfortable. A story of<br> heartbreak, Scum’s Wish shows us that sometimes the people we want to be with aren’t always the right<br> ones for us.</p>
